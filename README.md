## description
- Yet another ray tracer.
- A simple [ray tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) based on [Blinn-Phong reflection model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn%E2%80%93Phong_reflection_model).

## code
- Code is written in `C++`.
- `include/` & `src/` contains all the src code.
- `examples/` contains some example scene files.
- `textures/` contains texture files.
- `assignments/` contains problem statements from which this raytracer was created.

## documentation
- The documentation for the code is itself.

## usage

### how to run? [linux]
- Compile the raytracer using `make` to create an executable `raytracer`.
- The executable reads a scene file (and possibly some texture files) and generates a `ppm` image.
- Create the image of a scene using `./raytracer <path-to-scene-file>`. It will be in the same directory as the scene file.
    - For example, `./raytracer examples/scene.txt` creates `examples/scene.ppm`.

### format of scene file
- The format is similar to [.obj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) file format.
- Each line a the scene file defines something. Each line starts with a keyword and varying number of space separated parameters can follow.
- All colors are in normalized scale (0 - 1).
- The recognized keywords are as follows.
    - `# ...`: Comment. Will be ignored.
    - `eye x y z`: Camera position.
    - `viewdir x y z`: Camera viewing direction. Must be a unit vector.
    - `updir x y z`: Up direction. Must be a unit vector.
    - `vfov angle`: Vertical field of view in degrees.
    - `imsize width height`: Output image dimensions in pixels.
    - `bkgcolor r g b`: Background color.
    - `light x y z w r g b`: A light source.
        - `x y z` is position.
        - `w` can be 0 (directional source) or 1 (point source).
        - `r g b` is color.
    - `mtlcolor Odr Odg Odb Osr Osg Osb ka kd ks n a h`: Material color.
        - `Odr Odg Odb` is diffusion color.
        - `Osr Osg Osb` is specular color.
        - `ka kd ks` are ambient, diffusion and specular co-efficients respectively in the Blinn-Phong model.
        - `n` is the power in Blinn-Phong model.
        - `a` is opacity level (0 - 1).
        - `h` is refractive index.
    - `texture <path-to-texture-file>`: Path is assumed to start from raytracer executable directory. Has to be a valid `ppm` file.
    - `sphere x y z radius`: A spherical object.
    - `v x y z`: Vertex position.
    - `vt u v`: A texture coordinate. `u` & `v` must be in [0, 1].
    - `vn x y z`: A vertex normal definition. Must be a unit vector.
    - `f ...`: A face of a triangle.
        - All following arguments are indices of previously defined entities. The entities are counted from starting from 1 (and not 0).
        - `f v1 v2 v3`: `v1 v2 v3`: Vertex indices.
        - `f v1/vt1 v2/vt2 v3/vt2`: Vertex indices annotated with texture coordinate indices.
        - `f v1//vn1 v2//vn2 v3//vn3`: Vertex indices annotated with vertex normal indices.
        - `f v1/vt1/vn1 v2/vt2/vn2 v3/vt3/vn3`: Vertex indices annotated with texture coordinate indices & vertex normal indices.
    - `parallel`: Presence indicates that parallel projection is to be used. Default is `perspective`.
    - `viewdist distance`: Viewing distance for depth of field effect.
- Once a material color or texture is defined, it will be used for all the following objects in the scene until another is defined.
- For integer parameters, don't add a succeding decimal part.
    - `1` is ok.
    - `1.` is not okay. `1.0` is not okay.
    - This is caused merely because of the `cin` construct behaviour and has nothing to do with the ray tracer.

### ray tracer configuration
- Ray tracer has some configurable parameters, as listed with the defaults below.

| name | description | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CAMERA\_MEDIUM\_REFRACTIVE\_INDEX | Refractive index of medium camera is placed in. | 1 |
| CAMERA\_MEDIUM\_OPACITY | Opacity of medium camera is placed in. | 0 |
| RECURSIVE\_DEPTH | Number of times a ray reflects/refracts. Higher value produces more realistic effects. | 6 |
| SOFT\_SHADOW\_JITTER | Measure of dispersion of shadow rays. Higher value produces softer shadows. | 0 |
| NUM\_SHADOW\_RAYS\_PER\_POI | Number of shadow rays. Higher value produces softer shadows. | 1 |
| NUM\_DISTRIBUTED\_RAYS | Number of rays traced per pixel. Higher value produces more diffused image. | 10 |
| DISTRIBUTED\_RAYS\_JITTER | Measure of dispersion of rays traced per pixel. Higher value produces more diffused image.  | 5e-2 |

- To change config, directly edit these values in `src/main.cpp` and recompile.
